The project is written in the C++ programming language. 
Designed to implement <Stack> based on <Vector>. It consists of several files, each of which should have a value different from the others. Below is a summary of each file separately.

  file "stack.hpp"
Is our header file, in which Stack member variables, constructors,  destructors are declared and class methods are presented without implementation.

  file "stack.cpp"
This file implements the methods declared in the "stack.hpp" file and defines the constructors and destructors of the class

  file "s main.cpp"
This file is used to check the project's operability, testing. First of all, a object is created, then the correctness of the class methods (as well as the constructor and destructor) is checked.

  file "Makefile"
This particular file is designed to cache source type files so that we don't enter the name of each such file every time. He also performs partial campilitation.
